  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

    abstract = "This paper presents the approach of the iHealth-Chile-1 team for the shared task of Large-Scale Radiology Report Generation at the BioNLP workshop, inspired by progress in large multimodal models for processing images and text. In this work, we leverage LLaVA, a Visual-Language Model (VLM), composed of a vision-encoder, a vision-language connector or adapter, and a large language model able to process text and visual embeddings. We achieve our best result by enriching the input prompt of LLaVA with the text output of a simpler report generation model. With this enriched-prompt technique, we improve our results in 4 of 5 metrics (BLEU-4, Rouge-L, BertScore and F1-RadGraph,), only doing in-context learning. Moreover, we provide details about different architecture settings, fine-tuning strategies, and dataset configurations."
