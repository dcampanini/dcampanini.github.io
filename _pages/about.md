I am an Electrical Engineer from the University of Chile, I have been working for the last 2 years doing fundamental research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to address different medical tasks, such as medical report generation or medical visual question answering (VQA).

My research interests include multimodality, improving the projection of images into the latent space of Large Language Models, self-supervised learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.

Previously, I worked for 5 years a Data Scientist in a consulting company [Zenta](https://zentagroup.com/)  in Computer Vision on different problems, including object detection, people detection in mines to prevent fatalities, action classification, and supermarket shelf detection.
