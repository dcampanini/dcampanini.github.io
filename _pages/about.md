I am an Electrical Engineer from the University of Chile with 2 Google Cloud Certifications (Professional Machine Learning Engineer and Data Engineer). I am currently working at the research institute [iHealth](https://i-health.cl/), where I conduct fundamental research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for medical applications, including radiological report generation and medical visual question answering (VQA). I am advised by [Pablo A. Estevez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SM1ghUEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Denis Parra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aQ9TkcIAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests include multimodality, improving image projection into the latent space of Large Language Models, autoencoder architectures, data generation with diffusion models, self-supervised learning, uncertainty quantification, and explainable AI.

Previously, I worked for 5 years as a Data Scientist at the consulting company [Zenta](https://zentagroup.com/), and at the Advance Mining Technology Center ([AMTC](https://www.amtc.cl)). I participated in projects involving object detection, people detection in mines to prevent fatalities, action classification, supermarket shelf detection, sales forecasting, RAG-based chatbots, and client segmentation for [Cencosud](https://www.cencosud.com/en) one of the biggest retailers in Latin America.

I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Engineering with major in Electrical Engineering from the University of Chile, where I worked with [Javier Ruiz del Solar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U0XHBs8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Felipe Tobar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5XHRNwYAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Diana Dulic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6PJLDzkAAAAJ&hl=en).
