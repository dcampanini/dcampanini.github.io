I am an Electrical Engineer from the University of Chile, I have been working for 2 years doing research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to address different medical tasks, such as medical report generation or medical visual question answering (VQA).

Previously, I worked in Computer Vision on different problems, including object detection, people detection in mines to prevent fatalities, action classification, and supermarket shelf detection.

My research interests include multimodality, improving the projection of images into the latent space of Large Language Models, self-supervised learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.
